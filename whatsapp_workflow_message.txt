Index Align to Firebase Pipeline Workflow

1. Retrieves data from Index Align database
2. Transforms the data (ticker to company_id mapping)
3. Exports ALL data to JSON file for review
4. Auto-opens JSON file in your default viewer
5. Shows summary statistics and file location
6. Waits for you to review the JSON file
7. Asks: "Do you APPROVE this data for upload?"
8. Only uploads to Firebase if you type 'yes'

Safety Features:
- Manual review required before upload
- Complete data export for verification
- Explicit approval needed
- No automatic uploads

IMPORTANT: Review the JSON file carefully before approving!
